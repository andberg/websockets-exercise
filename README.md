===============
This is an Websocket-Exercise for my system-developer education at YHC3l using Java JSR 356 specification, http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jsr356-1937161.html

I used a MySQL database with Hibernate to my Java back-end and the previous developed floggit-postits as front-end. With some minor tweeks. 
It became a fairly good-looking app, but with some bugs that I have not had the time to fix yet. Will hopefully get to that soon enough.
