floggit_postits
===============
This is an Websocket-Exercise for my system-developer education at YHC3l using Java JSR 356 specification, http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jsr356-1937161.html

I used a MySQL database with Hibernate to my Java back-end and the previous developed floggit-postits as front-end. With some minor tweeks.
